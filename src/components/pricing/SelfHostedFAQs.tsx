                    <h3>What is the difference between Cloud and Self-Hosted?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you choose <strong>Gitpod Cloud</strong>, we will manage and host Gitpod in the cloud for you. This means minimal setup efforts for you and secure data storage in the cloud. Gitpod Cloud is be the best solution for teams who want to get started immediately and donâ€™t want to spend time on setup and operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        If you choose <strong>Gitpod Self-Hosted</strong>, you will manage and host Gitpod on your own instances. This means all data remains your infrastructure, as Gitpod can run behind corporate firewalls and on air-gapped networks. <strong>Gitpod Self-Hosted</strong> is the best solution for teams who want to keep full data control or use Gitpod in private networks.
