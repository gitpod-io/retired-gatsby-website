                <h3 >Liability for content</h3>
                <p>
                    As a service provider we are responsible according to § 7 paragraph 1 of TMG for own contents on these pages under the
                    general laws. According to § § 8 to 10 TMG we are not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored
                    foreign information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the
                    use of information under the general laws remain unaffected. However, a relevant liability is only possible from the
                    date of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.
                </p>
                <h3>Liability for links</h3>
                <p>
                    Our site contains links to external websites over which we have no control. Therefore we can not accept any responsibility
                    for their content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of any Linked
                    Site. The linked sites were checked at the time of linking for possible violations of law. Illegal contents were at the
                    time of linking. A permanent control of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. Upon
                    notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
                </p>
                <h3>Copyright</h3>

                    distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of its respective
                    author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. As far as
                    the content is not created by the website operator, the copyrights of third parties. Especially content of third parties
                    will be marked as such. If you still get aware of copyright infringement, we ask for a hint. Upon notification of violations,
                    we will remove such content immediately.
