## Overview

When you open Theia for the first time, a welcome screen is shown to quickly get you started. After
closing it you will see the workbench shell. Depending on the
[context URL](31_Context_Urls.md), different views might be opened.

Let us have a look at the primary elements of the workbench shell.

### Views and Editors

A Theia workbench shell consists of any number of opened views and editors. Views and editors can be
freely arranged by dragging and dropping them around.

### Main Area and Panels

Within the main area, the drag-and-drop functionality allows for splitting freely as you will. Also
widgets can be moved to the side or bottom panels.
