# Workspaces

A workspace is what you code in. It consists of the files, configuration and the underlying docker file.
Workspaces are created on the fly, driven by convention and configuration.

A Gitpod workspace can be created from any GitHub project, branch, issue, or pull request.
Very soon Gitpod will support additional platforms and integrate with GitLab, Bitbucket, and Jira.

In Gitpod workspaces usually have a very short life. Gitpod creates one when you need it and forgets about it when you are done.
There is no reason to go back and do any maintenance. Because everything is driven by configuration, you can always create a fresh one when you need it.
