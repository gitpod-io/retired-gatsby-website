# Feature Preview

You can enable Feature Preview from the Settings. This will enable a beta preview of some of the latest functionalities and features that are being actively developed for your user account. Some of them are user-facing features while others take place in the backstage.

You can disable Feature Preview at any time.

If you have suggestions on how we can improve a feature, please provide feedback by [opening an issue](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/new/choose).

> Once you enable this, existing and new workspaces will automatically start with all beta features. Disabling this could make existing workspaces unstable. 

## Root Access

Root Access allows you to attain privileged control within a workspace and be able to run commands as root.

This feature also enables Docker in your workspace. Run `sudo docker-up` to start a Docker daemon.

## Default IDE

Gitpod uses Theia as the default IDE. This setting allows you to choose between [Theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia) and [Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) editors as well as provide a custom IDE image.

You can choose between 3 options:

- Theia
- Code
- Custom
