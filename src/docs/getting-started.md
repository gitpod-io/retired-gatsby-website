# Getting Started

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) is an open source platform for automated and ready-to-code development environments that blends into your existing workflow. 

> For an overview of Gitpod you should first read [Introduction to Gitpod](/docs/).

You can start using Gitpod with one or more of the following ways:

- Use a [Prefixed URL](#prefixed-url)
- Install [Browser Extension](#browser-extension)
- Enable [GitLab Integration](#gitlab-integration)
- Quick start using an [Example Project](#example-project) or [OSS Project](#gitpodified-open-source-project)

## Prefixed URL

You can quickly open a new workspace for your project using a context URL like repository, branch, pull request, issue, or file. Just prefix the URL in the address bar of your browser with `gitpod.io/#`.

For example, try opening [https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic](https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic) or [https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/merge_requests/2](https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/merge_requests/2).

## Browser Extension

For convenience, we've made a browser extension that works with Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. The extension adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket so you can easily open a new workspace for any existing project.

## GitLab Integration

GitLab comes with a native Gitpod which is enabled by default for GitLab.com. To use the GitLab integration, you need to enable it from your [user preferences](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/preferences) at GitLab. Then you can choose to open a Gitpod workspace as an alternative to the GitLab Web IDE directly from GitLab for any existing project.

## Example Project

We've alrelay added Gitpod configuration for some example or existing projects.

You can pick any of the example projects listed under [Languages & Frameworks](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/).

For example, try opening [Vuepress](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress) or a [Java with Spring Boot](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic) example.

## Gitpodified Open Source Projects {#gitpodified-open-source-project}

We all know that setting up a local dev environment for a contribution to your favourite OSS project can be daunting. Luckily there are already numerous projects out there that gitpodified their repositories allowing everyone to contribute with a single click. With [contribute.dev](https://contribute.dev/) we even made a website to list them. 

For example try opening some of our favorite OSS projects out there: 
- [freeCodeCamp](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)
- [Prometheus](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
- [GitLab](https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
- [Forem](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to) powering dev.to
