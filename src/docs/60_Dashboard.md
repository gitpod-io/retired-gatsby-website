# Dashboard

Gitpod's dashboard allows you to log in and out, navigate through all your workspaces, and view
details of your account and subscription. It can be reached by pointing your browser to
[https://gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io).

If you are not logged in, you will see a _Log in_ button. Otherwise, the top-right corner will
display your avatar's picture. Clicking it will reveal the User Menu.

## Workspaces

By default, the dashboard shows you a list of your workspaces and their current state. The list is
sorted by relevance (running workspaces first). It can be searched using the search field.

Each entry provides information about the workspace's name, creation date, workspace context
(repository, branch, commit ID, issue, or pull-request), execution state (e.g. _Starting_,
_Stopping_, _Last run_).

Workspaces can be started, opened, or stopped using the respective buttons.

You can also enable/disable sharing of a workspace by clicking the lock icon. See the section on
[collaboration](33_Sharing_and_Collaboration.md) for details about sharing workspaces.

### Archived Workspaces

You can _archive_ a workspace if you do not want it to appear in the list.

If you try to open a workspace from an existing context, Gitpod will redirect you to the dashboard
to let you choose whether to open a new workspace or reuse an existing one. Archived workspaces will
not be taken into account.

## Account Details

Account details can be accessed via the _User Menu > Account details_. This page allows you to add or
remove accounts to code hosting platforms and manage your Gitpod subscription. It also gives you a
tabular view on your Gitpod usage.

## Log Out

You can log out of Gitpod using _Log out_ from the _User Menu_. Note that your GitHub authentication
token will be preserved for the next time you log in.
