While Gitpod doesn't currently support Julia out-of-the-box, it's easy to set up your Julia project in Gitpod.

A great example for a ready-to-code Julia dev environment is: [JesterOrNot/Gitpod-Julia](https://github.com/JesterOrNot/Gitpod-Julia).

Here is a real project with an automated Gitpod setup!
