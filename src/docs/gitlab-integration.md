# GitLab Integration

Gitpod comes with GitLab integration that allows you to start dev environments for all your GitLab projects.

## Starting Workspaces

To launch new Gitpod workspaces for your projects, issues, branches, merge requests, etc. you can prefix any GitLab URL with `gitpod.io/#` (or your respective Gitpod Self-Hosted URL) as described in the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) page.
Alternatively, the [browser extension](/docs/browser-extension/) can be installed to add a convenient Gitpod button to every GitLab page.


## Enabling Prebuilds

To enable [prebuilt workspaces](/docs/prebuilds/) for your GitLab project you need to grant `allow api calls` in Gitpod's [Access Control](/access-control/) page. This allows Gitpod to install a webhook. The webhook creates a new prebuild for every push event.

The webhook will be automatically installed when you trigger the first prebuild manually. For this, prefix your GitLab project URL with `gitpod.io/#prebuild/` as described in the [prebuilds page](/docs/prebuilds/#on-gitlab-and-bitbucket).

## OAuth Application

In Gitpod Self-Hosted you can register your own GitLab OAuth application. This allows to use Gitpod with any GitLab instance.

Here's how to do that:

1) When first starting your Gitpod installation, you'll get redirected to /first-steps where you get prompted to add a Git Provider. Click the button.

2) In the pop-up you choose GitLab as the type and type the host URL of the GitLab installation you want to use. If you want to hook up with the gitlab.com you can use that host as well, of course.

3) The form for your GitLab integration now shows three values. The first one is the redirect URL, that you need to register on the GitLab side. Copy the redirect Url to your clipboard

4) Go to /profile/applications on your GitLab installation to create an OAuth App. Type in a name (e.g. Gitpod) and paste the Redirect URL in the corresponding text area. Check the scopes `api` and `read_user`. Click the button "Save Application" below.

5) Copy the `Application ID` and the `Secret` in the corresponding form fields (`Client ID` resp. `Client Secret`) of your Gitpod installation.

6) Press `Connect` and go through the Auth flow the first time.

Congrats you have setup the GitLab integration. 🎉

Next up you should install the browser extension and [configure it with your Gitpod installation URL](/docs/browser-extension/#use-with-gitpod-self-hosted).
