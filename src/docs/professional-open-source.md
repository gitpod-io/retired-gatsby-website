# Professional Open Source

It wouldn't have been possible for us to create Gitpod without all of the amazing open-source work it's built upon. And still, we're developing huge parts of Gitpod out in the open.

Deeply devoted to the open-source community, we are happy to provide the professional open-source community a free **Professional Open Source** plan.

## What does it include?
No more hour restrictions, you'll be able to use Gitpod for any number of hours, on any public GitHub or GitLab repository.

## Who is eligible?

You should meet **at least one** of the following requirements:
1. You are a maintainer, or core contributor, of a well-established open-source project
2. A significant part of your income is from open source work (e.g. via Liberapay, Open Collective, GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, etc)
3. You regularly contribute to open source in other ways (e.g. producing regular content like blog posts, videos, live streams, or organizing meet-ups, conferences, hackathons, etc)

Does one of the above apply to your work? If so, please [get in touch](/contact/) and provide links to your projects. We'd love to see what you're working on.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions.
