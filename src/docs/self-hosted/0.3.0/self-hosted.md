# Gitpod Self-Hosted

Gitpod, just as you know it from [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io), can be installed and operated on your own infrastructure.
This infrastructure may be a cloud provider or self-managed Kubernetes. It may be on the public internet, behind a corporate firewall, or on a network without internet access.

  > Gitpod self-hosted is free for up to three users.
  > For more users, please obtain a [free trial license](https://gitpod.io/selfhosted-trial/).

## Installation

Regardless of your target environment, you will need to ensure that the [installation prerequisites](../install/01_prepare_installation/) are available.
Gitpod can be installed in the following environments:
* [Vanilla Kubernetes](../install/10_install_on_kubernetes/): All you need is a domain and a Kubernetes cluster.
* [Google Cloud Platform](../install/11_install_on_gcp_script/): Install Gitpod optimised for Google Cloud Platform.
