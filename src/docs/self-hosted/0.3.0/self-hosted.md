# Gitpod Self-Hosted

Gitpod can be installed and operated on your own infrastructure just as you know it from [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io).
This infrastructure may be a cloud provider or self-managed Kubernetes cluster. It may be on the internet, behind firewall or on an isolated network.

  > Gitpod self-hosted is free for up to 3 users.
  > For more users please obtain a [free trial license](https://gitpod.io/selfhosted-trial/).
