# Database
This chart installs a MySQL database which gets Gitpod up and running but is not suitable for production (the data is lost on each restart of the DB pod). To connect to a porper MySQL installation:
   - initialize your MySQL database using the SQL files in `database/`. E.g. in a mysql session connected to your database server run:
     ```
     SET @gitpodDbPassword = IFNULL(@gitpodDbPassword, 'your-password-goes-here');
     source database/01-create-user.sql;
     source database/02-create-and-init-sessions-db.sql;
     source database/03-recreate-gitpod-db.sql;
     ```
   - `echo values/database.yaml >> configuration.txt`
   - in `values/database.yaml` change the values in `gitpod.db` to match your installation
