# Gitpod Self-Hosted

Gitpod, just as you know it from [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io), can be installed and operated on your own infrastructure.
This infrastructure may be a cloud provider or self-managed Kubernetes. It may be on the public internet, behind a corporate firewall, or on a network without internet access.

  > Gitpod self-hosted is free for up to three users.
  > For more users, please obtain a [free trial license](https://gitpod.io/selfhosted-trial/).

## Installation

Gitpod can be installed in the following environments:
* [Vanilla Kubernetes](../install/install-on-kubernetes/): All you need is a domain and a Kubernetes cluster.
* [Google Cloud Platform](../install/install-on-gcp-script/): Install Gitpod optimised for Google Cloud Platform.
