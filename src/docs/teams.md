# Team Subscription

A team subscription lets you manage subscriptions for your entire team with one billing contact. 

##Creating a Team Subscription
The professional plan, as well as the unlimited plan allow you to create a team subscription. On https://gitpod.io/teams/ you can select a subscription and add members to it. If you don’t have a Gitpod account yet, you’ll be asked to create one first.

Then you can choose how many seats you’d like to purchase and in which currency you’d like to be billed. 

Afterwards you have two options of adding your team members. 
You can either directly assign a seat by entering your team members GitHub username or use the `Invite Team` button and get a shareable link. Send the link to your team, and they can claim a seat.

##Good to know
* You don’t need to have a subscription yourself to manage seats for your team. 
* If you’d like to add more seats, delete seats or reassign existing seats, you can do these changes at any time.
