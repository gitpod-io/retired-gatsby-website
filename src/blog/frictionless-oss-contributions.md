To celebrate Open Source and Hacktoberfest, we're stoked ðŸ§™âœ¨ðŸ¥° to announce <a href="https://contribute.dev" target="blank">contribute.dev</a>, a list of welcoming open-source projects featuring ready-to-code Gitpod setups.

![Projects List](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46004116/66307071-d695ac00-e91c-11e9-9eb1-8aa97bb6ca67.png)

Setup for all of the listed projects is completely automated with the help of [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io). So within seconds, you get a fully working development environment, including a VS Code-like interface and a cloud-based Linux container configured specifically for the project. All you need is a browser!

For getting started with the project of your choice just hit the blue `Open in Gitpod` button in the bottom right corner:

This will launch a ready-to-code environment with everything setup (like the dependencies pre-installed and the web server running) as shown below.

Now you can make your contribution and once you're done you can do all sorts of cool stuff from within the full-featured Gitpod IDE like reviewing the changes that you made in the diff editor or making a Pull Request.

##Want the same for your project?

If the project that you're looking for is not in the list please file an issue [here &rarr;](https://github.com/gitpod-io/contribute.dev/issues/new?labels=&template=add-project.md&title=Add+%3CRepo+URL+here%3E) with a link to your repository and we'll help you set it up. Once the experience is great we're happy to add your project to the list.

Happy contributing! ðŸ¥°
