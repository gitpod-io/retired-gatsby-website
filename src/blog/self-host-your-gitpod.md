Eighteen months ago we launched the public beta of Gitpod.
That date marked the beginning of an amazing journey with plenty of feedback, fixes and improvements.
It is exciting to see how far we have come and where that simple idea of instant, ready-to-code workspaces has taken us.

None of this would have been possible if it weren't for the troves of developers, hackers, coders and other purveyors of Open-Source who provide ample feedback and use Gitpod as their IDE of choice.
If the technical side of Gitpod is fun, the user side of Gitpod is truly amazing. We are blown away every day because of the quantity and quality of what you guys do with Gitpod.

However, until now Gitpod has not truly been available for everyone.
There are many situations, especially in the enterprise, where giving a third-party cloud service access to your code and repositories is out of question.
Maybe the codebase you work on is living on a GitLab instance somewhere locked down in your company's network.
Maybe your budgetary requirements do not permit paying for a SaaS product, but only allow for on-premise licenses.

Starting today we enter the public beta of Gitpod Self-Hosted.
Much like eighteen months ago, this marks the starting point of a new section of our journey.
We are very excited to enable more people to focus on what they're good at, with Gitpod becoming a part of their enterprise tooling landscape.

Other than running on your infrastructure, Gitpod Self-Hosted also works with self-hosted GitLab installations.
If you are running your own GitLab installation already, adding Gitpod to the mix turns this into a power-house of on-prem tooling.

Gitpod Self-Hosted is free for up to three users. If you're a small shop that will get you up and running.
If you need more, there is a [free one-month unlimited license](https://gitpod.io/selfhosted-trail) available.
And just in case, if you need support running your PoC in-house please [reach out](mailto:contact@gitpod.io) and we'll be happy to help.
Our remodeled [community](https://community.gitpod.io/) will also fill with helpful tips and tricks regarding Gitpod Self-Hosted.

To get started, head over to the [Self-Hosted documentation](https://gitpod-staging.netlify.com/docs/self-hosted/latest/self-hosted/).
There you can find everything about the requirements, supported environments and steps involved.

We are absolutely thrilled to see how Gitpod and its community grows. Self-Hosted will enable even more people to spend time coding, not setting up their machine.
