GitHub has announced the public availability of GitHub Codespaces today at their Universe conference. Their investment into GitHub Codespaces pushes what Gitpod has been pioneering into the mainstream.

In this post we would like to share some context and information around the rapidly spreading idea of automated dev environments within the developer community. Also, we‚Äôd like to point out some differences between Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces.

Since [we've started building Gitpod in July-2017](/blog/gitpod-online-ide/), we firmly believe that fully-automated development environments will be the standard for professional developers in 5-10 years. With a big player like Microsoft entering the market this whole space will gain additional velocity.

We certainly welcome the additional push Codespaces will bring, but it is important to communicate how and why [Gitpod is better than Codespaces](/gitpod-vs-github-codespaces/).

### Gitpod is Open-Source, Multi-Cloud, and Works With GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket

Gitpod is an open-source platform which means you get full transparency over how Gitpod works and can even contribute to it. The vibrant open-source community of Gitpod welcomes everyone, and empowers them to develop additional features without restrictions. 

Furthermore, you can run Gitpod on your own infrastructure and any cloud provider. Unlike Microsoft/GitHub, Gitpod‚Äôs business objective is not driving cloud revenues to specific cloud providers such as Azure. As a true independent alternative Gitpod seamlessly works with GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. Gitpod can be deployed to public, private or hybrid clouds, neatly integrating into your infrastructure, giving you full control of your system and your source code.

### Gitpod is More Powerful 

As a highly-optimized Kubernetes application Gitpod is built on next-gen container technology instead of VMs, which GitHub Codespaces relies on. This allows Gitpod to offer its SaaS service for less than half the price of GitHub Codespaces.

Compared to virtual machines, isolating workspace containers from each other is harder. At Gitpod we‚Äôve integrated the latest container isolation mechanisms that securely allow users to benefit from the resource efficiency of containers while still having root privileges. Here‚Äôs a [great technical presentation](https://youtu.be/l4I2TVAnBuw?t=174) explaining how we make this happen.

The result is that Gitpod offers a far better cloud density compared to VMs, resulting in more powerful dev environments with a much smaller ecological footprint. Furthermore, we run Gitpod.io on a 100% carbon-neutral cloud service ‚ù§Ô∏èüåç

### Gitpod is Faster 

Gitpod is not only faster than Codespaces because of the higher efficiency, but also because of our prebuilds. Let‚Äôs take a closer look.

The metric that matters here is time it takes until a dev environment is ready-to-code. Ready-to-code means that developers can actually start creating and don‚Äôt have to wait for builds, dependencies to download or code generators to run.

With Codespaces whenever you start a new dev environment, you are left with a raw copy of the code. So before you start coding, you‚Äôll need to run a bunch of processes and wait until they are finished. 

Gitpod can pre-build dev environments when a new commit is pushed to the remote repository. The following diagram illustrates the idea:

![Prebuilds Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/372735/101493570-870aa000-3966-11eb-9fe1-e32eb80449f0.png)

Besides Gitpod loading faster (it‚Äôs quicker to start containers than it is to start VMs), the advantages of having your dev environments prebuilt can not be overstated. For the [vscode repository](https://github.com/gitpod-io/vscode) we measured a 15x difference.

We believe prebuilding dev environments the way Gitpod does it, is key towards ‚Äúdev environments as code‚Äù. Without prebuilds, developers have to manually maintain and reuse their dev environments, because of the manual labour put into them. Those stateful environments drift apart over time and teams are once again working in very different setups, wasting time and energy with the resulting problems and surprises.

### The Road Ahead

The real competition is the habit of maintaining stateful environments on overpowered local machines. We welcome GitHub and Microsoft to join forces in convincing developers around the world about the workflow and productivity benefits of automated, cloud-based dev environments. 

We are excited about the things we announced yesterday around [Root, Docker and VS Code](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/root-docker-and-vscode/) and are already working on big plans we have for next year. 

Ephemeral dev environments are going to democratize software development. Allowing anyone to get into a productive coding state on any of their projects and branches with the click of a button is a massive productivity boost. In addition we keep the entire devops pipeline in a centralized, managed system, which provides more security and observability to today‚Äôs developer teams.

We will continue to focus on automating the provisioning of dev environments that blend in with your existing workflow, integrate into your existing infrastructure and run on any cloud or your own clusters. [We do all of this in the open](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod) and invite everyone to join us in building an open platform for secure, collaborative and always-ready-to-code development environments for all developers.
